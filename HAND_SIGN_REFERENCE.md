4. **Steadiness**: Hold pose for 1-2 seconds
5. **Clarity**: Make exaggerated, clear hand positions
6. **Visibility**: Ensure entire hand fits in frame
7. **Consistency**: Repeat letter a few times for confidence
8. **Both Hands**: Can detect both hands - try using both!

### Common Issues:

- **Low Confidence**: Improve lighting or hand clarity
- **Wrong Letter**: Make hand pose more distinct
- **No Detection**: Check lighting, ensure hand is visible
- **Shaky Detections**: Hold pose steadier, improve lighting
